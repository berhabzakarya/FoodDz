## Project Description
Food DZ is an **Android based Restaurant Management System** that aims to digitalize the process of various restaurant operations including **ordering, billing **. 

The main purpose is to **improve the performance** of the restaurant by eradicating the daily paperwork. With this system the tasks
would be performed in less amount of time and more efficiently. An additional benefit of this software is that during the rush hours the load can be balanced effectively, and restaurants would perform better than usual. In addition to this, human error that occurs when performing tasks manually is also minimized and presence of queues in the system to assign tasks to chefs can reduce congestion in the kitchen. The system would also result in reduction of labor which would result in the reduction of expenses of the restaurant. Feedback module would help the restaurant check for how well they are performing, and monthly/yearly figures can be checked by the billing module to see the trends in sales and profits. These benefits can potentially result in generation of more revenues for the restaurant. 



## How to Run

In order to have a look at the code files and understand the working, simply download this repository and open Android Studio and browse to the downloaded project and open it. It will load the project files and the code will be ready to run. 

Before running the app, use your Google Account to register this Application on Firebase Console, with any name you want. I have provided a copy of the **Firebase Database** [Firebase Realtime DB Backup](../master/database/Firebase%20Realtime%20DB%20Backup.json). Download it and import it in the Firebase console. Then you will have a working Database for the app. After that using your Google Account, login to Android Studio. Then you can run the project.
